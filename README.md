# InducingCognitiveProcesses

Inferring cognitive processes from observational data is a central element in the study of cognition. The assumption of a link between the observation of a process and the directly related cognitive process may, however, fall prey to a misattribution between the two. To improve our understanding of this mapping we collected eye-movement data from participants making decisions in risky gambles while either being instructed to use a specific strategy (expected value or lexicographic heuristic), or without a strategy instruction. We measured information acquisition patterns and attention to specific dimensions of the gambles.
